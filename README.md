# Chess
This has been the very bigger project I have made. 

Abstract: The objective of this year's project was to create a functional, aesthetically pleasing user interface for playing the world-famous chess game, which implements all the rules that belong to this game. This program supports the game between two players on one or more computers simultaneously, but it is also possible to play against the Stockfish chess engine according to the difficulty that was specified by user. It is also possible to play a modified version of this game called Fischer's Chess.
